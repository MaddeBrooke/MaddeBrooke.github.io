   	Personally, one of my favorite websites is Nike. I may be somewhat biased because I prefer Nike over any other athletic brand. However, regardless of my preferences, they have a lot to offer. One thing that stands out about Nike is their brand. It is very prominent and surrounds everything they do. This means that their beliefs and mission is authentically placed throughout their website, apps, products, and stores. I believe this is what sets Nike apart from other companies. </p>
	<p>Examining the code for any website gives us the ability to see how organized it is, or what can be improved. Nike’s code is very organized and uses the HTML coding language. This validates my opinion of Nike’s website. From a viewer's perspective, the website is clean and simple. It has tabs at the top to help with easy navigation. The website’s screen adjusts to different sizes depending on preference of the viewer. It is also compatible with multiple devices such as smartphones, ipads, laptops, etc. Nike uses bright colors, but they aren’t overwhelming because they are balanced with dark tones.The colors give it a sleek, athletic vibe. The whole website is very clean cut. In other words, it's symmetrical and balanced. They use a lot of square shapes with sharp edges and white space. Their website’s design markets well to top athletes. </p>
	<p>Airbnb is considered one of the best websites today. My initial impression of this website was the quick navigation. There are really only two things to do with Air bnb and that is to be a host or find somewhere to stay; They have these two options apparent at the top of their website. Airbnb’s website uses HTML language like Nike. Nike’s seemed to be a little more organized because the paragraphs were spaced out. Airbnb’s page source was all single-spaced, which made it seem a little overwhelming. What sets Airbnb apart from mediocre websites, in my opinion, is their use of color, font, and organization. They use light and woodsy tones to give it a chic feel. Their font has the same effect because it is rounded and soft. They have the same symmetrical and balanced concept that Nike has with the use of squares and white space. However, Airbnb’s squares are rounded instead of sharp. Nike and Airbnb both do great at matching their website designs with what they are selling. For example, Nike sells athletic gear so their website is motivational and shiny to appeal to athletes. Airbnb provides rental homes so their website is designed to feel comfortable and safe. </p>
   <p> Now that I have discussed a coupleof great websites, it’s time to compare them to a bad website. Craigslist is a poorly designed website. However, they are popular because of what they offer. Surprisingly, their page source seems fairly organized. It’s compiled of links to just about anything, but it is fairly spaced out like Nikes HTML document. This website has a few things to improve such as color, branding, attraction, etc. First of all, they only have the colors blue, grey, and white, which makes it seem very boring. Because Craigslist’s webpage is so bland, it makes it hard to relate to their brand, or have brand loyalty. One thing they have going for them is they have quite an array of consumers, probably because it is free to post on. I also think it’s fairly easy to navigate, I mean all you really need is the search bar and it’s apparent on the webpage. Craigslist’s website just isn’t attractive, and it doesn’t appeal to any kind of style or emotion because of it’s blandness.</p>
