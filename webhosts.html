    <h1><b>Best Web Host</b></h1>
    <p>Bluehost, Hostgator, and Hostinger are all great web hosts for anyone who wants to create a website. They each are currently working for millions of people. If I had to choose a top host out of these three, I would pick Hostinger. Since I have the perspective of a beginning web designer, with little to no experience, the first thing that caught my attention was how popular hostinger is. They are currently working with 29 million customers, which is much larger than Bluehost and Hostgator. Hostinger is also the cheapest out of the three web hosts and offers much of the same options like unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage, SSL security etc. As a beginning web designer, Hostinger seems to be the most attractive.   </p>
