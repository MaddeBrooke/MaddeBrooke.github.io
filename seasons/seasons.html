        <p><img src="leaves.jpg" class="tide">"The seasons are four different times during the year with different types of weather. The four seasons are called spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Seasons change throughout the year because of the way the earth moves. The earth orbits, or travels around, the sun. As it orbits, it spins on its own axis, too. Imagine there was a straight pole that went through the center of the earth, from the North Pole to the South Pole; this is the earth's axis" (study.com)</p>
