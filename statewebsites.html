    <h1>Review of State Websites</h1>

    <h2>Vermont Website: Favorite</h2>
    <a href="https://www.vermont.gov/#gsc.tab=0">Vermont.gov</a>
    <p>I love the design and colors. It has a beautiful picture of the capital building on the front page. The first page is all links to prevalent news such as the corona virus. It is easy to navigate and adjusts well to different screen sizes. It is very organized and the html looks tidy. This is my favorite out of the 5 websites because it is eye appealing and easy to naigate.  </p>
   
    <h2>Alaska Website: 2</h2>
    <a href="https://alaska.gov">Alaska.gov</a>
    <p>The colors and design for this website aren't very appealing. It looks boring, and does not adjust to different screen sizes. However, it loads quickly and is organized. It's easy to find something by hovering over the menu buttons. The html looks fairly organized as well, from what I can see.   </p>
    
    <h2>Iowa Website: 3</h2>
    <a href="https://www.iowa.gov/">Iowa.gov</a>
    <p>This website is fairly eye appealing loads quickly, and works in multiple screen sizes. I think the content is a little overwhelming, I'm not sure I would be able to find anything quickly. It would help if the menu buttons had a drop-down list.</p>
    
   <h2>Tennessee Website: 4</h2>
    <a href="https://www.tn.gov/">Tennessee.gov</a>
    <p>I don't like the design or colors as much on this one. I guess it is the state colors, so that's fair. The html is organized and it looks like the website is easy enough to navigate. It also adjusts to different screen sizes.  </p>
    
    <h2>Oklahoma Website: Least Favorite</h2>
    <a href="https://oklahoma.gov/">Oklahoma.gov</a>
    <p>I don't like the design on this website as much as the other ones. The html looks like it could use better organization, and you have to look around on the website to find where you need to go. There's not a convenient menu or drop down list at the top. It does adjust to other screen sizes. This is my least favorite website because it is very annoying when I can't find what I need quickly.  </p>
